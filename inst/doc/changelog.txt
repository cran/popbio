New features by version.

#############

changes in version 1.1.7

* added Calathea to LTRE example with plot, year, and interaction
  effects

* added s3 method for function mean.list to get the mean matrix from a list of
  matrices.  

#############

changes in version 1.1.6

* changed ltre to LTRE

* added plots to vitalsens example

#############

changes in version 1.1.5

* added ltre function for fixed LTRE.  A random design is included in the
  example

* added Calathea dataset for tropical understory herb in Horvitz and
  Schemske (1995)

* fix damping ratio in eigen.analysis.  Now the function finds the
  second largest modulus  and not just modulus of the second eigenvalue ( in case
  of eigenvalues with equal magnitudes in imprimitive matrices).
  Also, added which.max to find dominant eigenvalue instead of
   which(Re(ev$values)==max(Re(ev$values))).   

#############

changes in version 1.1.4

* fixed error in image plot on teasel example

#############

changes in version 1.1.3

* added function vitalsens for vital rate sensitivities and
  elasticities 

* added matplots to teasel example

* changed name of lambda to lambda1 in eigen.analysis output to match
  package demogR (in case demogR is loaded after popbio, then
  functions using eigen.analysis should still work - unless matrix is
  singular)


#############

changes in version 1.1.2

* fixed undefined nyrs variable in varEst

* added checks to head2 function to work with matrix or dataframe
  input only 

* removed extra brackets, foreign language encodings (Akcakaya) in .Rd
  files requested by JSS editors

#############

changes in version 1.1.1 

* added pfister.plot to create log-log plots of variance
  vs. sensitivity and CV vs. elasticity

* added more plotting examples (fig 9.3, 9.4, 9.11) from chap 9 in
  Caswell to teasel and tortoise datasets

* added age-specific survival and fertility curves (fig 5.1 and 5.2)
  to whale dataset

* corrected errors in hudcorr matrices and vitalsim function suggested
  by Doak in email dated 8/4/07.

* added plot based on fig 8.3 to vitalsim function and code (not run)
  to simulate no correlations or only within-year correlations

* changed colors in stage.vector.plot to rainbow(8)

* added column names to boot.transitions (vector and matrix output,
  e.g., a11, a21, a31 a12, ...) and pop.projection  output 
 
* changed stage.vector.plot examples to project matrix in example 2.1
  in Caswell and create figure 2.3.

###################
Changes in version 1.1

* added many new functions and datasets contirubted by Patrick Nantel

* added default row and column names (if missing) to stage.vector.plot,
  checks for matrix with 2 or more stages, and repeat
  colors if necessary

* now checking if matrix is singular in eigen.analysis.  If matrix is
  singular, NA values are used instead of exiting with a warning.
  This is useful for bootstrapping that may create singular matrices
  (and you don't want to exit with error if calculating
  elasticities/sensitivies or other bootstrap parameter).  

* added print statements on long loops used in all three  stochastic growth  functions to track progress
 
* now rounding stages in vector before checking extinction probability
  in stoch.quasi.ext.  Now if vector is (.3,.4,.4) and ext prob=1 then
  rounding stages sets n=0.
